# Active Context: Sunu Rekolt

**Date:** 2024-07-28

## 1. Current Focus

*   **Phase 2/4:** Implementing Order History & Status Updates - Completed Farmer Order Detail View.
*   **Next:** Choose next feature: Add Product, Farmer Dashboard, Payment Integration, or address Linter/Other issues.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   Completed **Phase 1.**
*   **Dependencies:** Resolved.
*   **Components:** `ProductCard.tsx` refined.
*   **Catalogue/Detail:** Verified fetch works, joins successful, RLS resolved.
*   **Context:** `AuthContext.tsx`, `CartContext.tsx` reviewed/verified.
*   **Auth Screens:** Login & Register screens reviewed/verified.
*   **Cart Implementation:** Reviewed.
*   **Checkout Flow:** Added address fields to Payment screen and order creation.
*   **Order Confirmation:** Screen implemented and tested (shows details, address, farmer phone).
*   **Profile Screen Orders:** Implemented separate Received/Placed lists, status updates, fixed "Invalid Date" mapping.
*   **Farmer Order Detail Screen (`app/(tabs)/farmer-order-detail/[id].tsx`):**
    *   Successfully implemented data fetching using a `SECURITY DEFINER` SQL function (`get_order_details_for_farmer`) to bypass RLS recursion errors (`PGRST116`/`42P17`).
    *   Resolved persistent `SyntaxError` on `Alert.alert`.
    *   Screen now loads correctly, displays buyer info, items, and allows status updates.
*   **RLS:** Added necessary policies for farmer/buyer interactions (profile read, order read, status updates), dropped recursive policy on `orders`.

## 3. Next Steps

*   **Implement Image Picker:** Add UI and logic for selecting/uploading profile and field pictures in `app/(tabs)/edit-profile.tsx`.
*   **Refine Error Handling** across the app.
*   **Address Remaining Profile Actions:** Implement screens for Order History, My Products, Dashboard, etc.

## 4. Open Questions / Decisions

*   Confirm UI library preference.
*   Finalize API service layer structure.
*   Exact PayDunya integration flow.
*   Source of "activity stats" error.

## 5. Blockers

*   Persistent project-level TypeScript/JSX configuration errors (Linter noise).
*   Uninvestigated `TouchableOpacity` `ReferenceError` on Order Confirmation screen.

### Current Work Focus

- **Task:** Successfully implemented and debugged the Farmer Order Detail screen.
- **Status:** Farmer order flow (Profile list -> Detail view -> Status update) is functional. RLS recursion and SyntaxError issues resolved.
- **Next Steps:** User to select the next feature or issue to address.

### Recent Changes

- Implemented `handleUpdateOrderStatus` and `handleCallBuyer` in `FarmerOrderDetailScreen`.
- Implemented `fetchOrderBuyerAndItems` using RPC call to `get_order_details_for_farmer`.
- Added SQL function `get_order_details_for_farmer` via migration.
- Dropped recursive RLS policy on `orders` table via migration.
- Resolved SyntaxError in `handleCallBuyer`.
- Fixed date mapping (`createdAt`) in `ProfileScreen` for received orders.

- Implemented `fetchOrderBuyerAndItems` using RPC call to `get_order_details_for_farmer`.
- Added SQL function `get_order_details_for_farmer` via migration.
- Dropped recursive RLS policy on `orders` table via migration.
- Resolved SyntaxError in `handleCallBuyer`.
- Fixed date mapping (`createdAt`) in `ProfileScreen` for received orders.

### Active Decisions & Considerations

- Need to address persistent JSX/TypeScript linter errors later.
- Need to investigate `TouchableOpacity` `ReferenceError` later.

## 338. Open Questions / Decisions

*   Confirm UI library preference.
*   Finalize API service layer structure.
*   Exact PayDunya integration flow.
*   Source of "activity stats" error.

## 339. Blockers

*   Persistent project-level TypeScript/JSX configuration errors (Linter noise).
*   Uninvestigated `TouchableOpacity` `ReferenceError` on Order Confirmation screen.

### Current Work Focus

- **Task:** Successfully implemented and debugged the Farmer Order Detail screen.
- **Status:** Farmer order flow (Profile list -> Detail view -> Status update) is functional. RLS recursion and SyntaxError issues resolved.
*   **Next Steps:** User to select the next feature or issue to address.
